# Grocery Store
## Codecademy Project

>Grocery stores have lots of information to keep track of: inventory, customers, prices, sales, employees, shipping, receiving, and on and on. We are going to start building a small part of that here.

>For now, we are going to focus on one specific product in a grocery store: apples. We will put together basic information about them and display the information in the end. You will be using the skills you learned about variables in C to do this work. Letâ€™s get started!

---

### Code
Codecademy provides the starting code below:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
// Put all your code above this and if you declare your variables using the given names and types there is no need to change any of the code below.
printf("An apple costs: $%.2f, there are %d in inventory found in section: %c and your customers gave it an average review of %d%%!", applePrice, appleQuantity, appleLocation, appleReviewDisplay);

}
```

### Tasks

- Create variables needed with the correct type
- Set the value of variables either at declaration or by assignment
- Assign constant variables using the recommended syntax (caps)
- Cast variables
- Use arithmetic operators to calculate sales
